\section{Introduction}

HapMap3 variants \cite[]{international2010integrating} have been used as a set of well imputed variants across many human genetics studies; is this hypothesis verified?

Here, we provide an empirical set of well imputed variants across multiple studies to be used in genetic analyses that [require transfering sumstats...].
We demonstrate that [blabla...]

\section{Methods}

We searched for recent summary statistics providing the INFO score (imputation accuracy) information. 
We looked and analysed the
