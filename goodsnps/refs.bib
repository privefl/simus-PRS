@article{Lehoucq1996,
	abstract = {A deflation procedure is introduced that is designed to improve the convergence of an implicitly restarted Arnoldi iteration for computing a few eigenvalues of a large matrix. As the iteration progresses, the Ritz value approximations of the eigenvalues converge at different rates. A numerically stable scheme is introduced that implicitly deflates the converged approximations from the iteration. We present two forms of implicit deflation. The first, a locking operation, decouples converged Ritz values and associated vectors from the active part of the iteration. The second, a purging operation, removes unwanted but converged Ritz pairs. Convergence of the iteration is improved and a reduction in computational effort is also achieved. The deflation strategies make it possible to compute multiple or clustered eigenvalues with a single vector restart method. A block method is not required. These schemes are analyzed with respect to numerical stability, and computational results are presented.},
